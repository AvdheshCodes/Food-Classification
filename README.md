This repository contains code to detect a food and find out the nutrients contained in it. This project aims to help users find out what types of food and nutrients are contained in these foods so that users can adjust their daily nutritional needs.

Through the research we have done, we found one approach to find a solution to the problem. We use the Transfer Learning approach with the help of Libraries from TensorFlow.
